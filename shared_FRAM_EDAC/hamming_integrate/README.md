Steps to use these files:
1) Access the CommandControl/Spi_FRAM/SPI_FRAM_test_L1 folder (its in the git repo)
2) Use the Src/ folder and SPI_FRAM.c & SPI_FRAM.h in OBC/shared-FRAM_EDAC/hamming_integrate to replace the folder and files of the same name in ../SPI_FRAM_test_L1 
3) Open the MDK-ARM file and run away.
